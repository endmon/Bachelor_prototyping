        "plaintext": "Ghost comes with a best-in-class editor which does its very best to get out of\nthe way, and let you focus on your content. Don't let its minimal looks fool\nyou, though, beneath the surface lies a powerful editing toolset designed to\naccommodate the extensive needs of modern creators.\n\nFor many, the base canvas of the Ghost editor will feel familiar. You can start\nwriting as you would expect, highlight content to access the toolbar you would\nexpect, and generally use all of the keyboard shortcuts you would expect.\n\nOur main focus in building the Ghost editor is to try and make as many things\nthat you hope/expect might work: actually work. \n\n * You can copy and paste raw content from web pages, and Ghost will do its best\n   to correctly preserve the formatting. \n * Pasting an image from your clipboard will upload inline.\n * Pasting a social media URL will automatically create an embed.\n * Highlight a word in the editor and paste a URL from your clipboard on top:\n   Ghost will turn it into a link.\n * You can also paste (or write!) Markdown and Ghost will usually be able to\n   auto-convert it into fully editable, formatted content.\n\nThe Ghost editor. Also available in dark-mode, for late night writing sessions.\nThe goal, as much as possible, is for things to work so that you don't have to \nthink so much about the editor. You won't find any disastrous \"block builders\"\nhere, where you have to open 6 submenus and choose from 18 different but\nidentical alignment options. That's not what Ghost is about.\n\nWhat you will find though, is dynamic cards which allow you to embed rich media\ninto your posts and create beautifully laid out stories.\n\nUsing cards\nYou can insert dynamic cards inside post content using the + button, which\nappears on new lines, or by typing / on a new line to trigger the card menu.\nMany of the choices are simple and intuitive, like bookmark cards, which allow\nyou to create rich links with embedded structured data:\n\nOpen Subscription PlatformsA shared movement for independent subscription data.\nOpen Subscription Platforms [https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/]or embed\ncards which make it easy to insert content you want to share with your audience,\nfrom external services:\n\nBut, dig a little deeper, and you'll also find more advanced cards, like one\nthat only shows up in email newsletters (great for personalized introductions)\nand a comprehensive set of specialized cards for different types of images and\ngalleries.\n\n> Once you  start mixing text and image cards creatively, the whole narrative of\nthe story changes. Suddenly, you're working in a new format.\nAs it turns out, sometimes pictures and a thousand words go together really\nwell. Telling people a great story often has much more impact if they can feel,\neven for a moment, as though they were right there with you.\n\nPeaceful placesGalleries and image cards can be combined in so many different\nways — the only limit is your imagination.\n\nBuild workflows with snippets\nOne of the most powerful features of the Ghost editor is the ability to create\nand re-use content snippets. If you've ever used an email client with a concept\nof saved replies then this will be immediately intuitive.\n\nTo create a snippet, select a piece of content in the editor that you'd like to\nre-use in future, then click on the snippet icon in the toolbar. Give your\nsnippet a name, and you're all done. Now your snippet will be available from\nwithin the card menu, or you can search for it directly using the / command.\n\nThis works really well for saving images you might want to use often, like a\ncompany logo or team photo, links to resources you find yourself often linking\nto, or introductions and passages that you want to remember.\n\nYou can even build entire post templates or outlines to create a quick,\nre-usable workflow for publishing over time. Or build custom design elements for\nyour post with an HTML card, and use a snippet to insert it.\n\nOnce you get a few useful snippets set up, it's difficult to go back to the old\nway of diving through media libraries and trawling for that one thing you know\nyou used somewhere that one time.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPublishing and newsletters the easy way\nWhen you're ready to publish, Ghost makes it as simple as possible to deliver\nyour new post to all your existing members. Just hit the Preview link and you'll\nget a chance to see what your content looks like on Web, Mobile, Email and\nSocial.\n\nYou can send yourself a test newsletter to make sure everything looks good in\nyour email client, and then hit the Publish button to decide who to deliver it\nto.\n\nGhost comes with a streamlined, optimized email newsletter template that has\nsettings built-in for you to customize the colors and typography. We've spent\ncountless hours refining the template to make sure it works great across all\nemail clients, and performs well for email deliverability.\n\nSo, you don't need to fight the awful process of building a custom email\ntemplate from scratch. It's all done already!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Ghost editor is powerful enough to do whatever you want it to do. With a\nlittle exploration, you'll be up and running in no time.",

        "plaintext": "Hey there, welcome to your new home on the web! \n\nUnlike social networks, this one is all yours. Publish your work on a custom\ndomain, invite your audience to subscribe, send them new content by email\nnewsletter, and offer premium subscriptions to generate sustainable recurring\nrevenue to fund your work. \n\nGhost is an independent, open source app, which means you can customize\nabsolutely everything. Inside the admin area, you'll find straightforward\ncontrols for changing themes, colors, navigation, logos and settings — so you\ncan set your site up just how you like it. No technical knowledge required.\n\nIf you're feeling a little more adventurous, there's really no limit to what's\npossible. With just a little bit of HTML and CSS you can modify or build your\nvery own theme from scratch, or connect to Zapier to explore advanced\nintegrations. Advanced developers can go even further and build entirely custom\nworkflows using the Ghost API.\n\nThis level of customization means that Ghost grows with you. It's easy to get\nstarted, but there's always another level of what's possible. So, you won't find\nyourself outgrowing the app in a few months time and wishing you'd chosen\nsomething more powerful!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor now, you're probably just wondering what to do first. To help get you going\nas quickly as possible, we've populated your site with starter content (like\nthis post!) covering all the key concepts and features of the product.\n\nYou'll find an outline of all the different topics below, with links to each\nsection so you can explore the parts that interest you most.\n\nOnce you're ready to begin publishing and want to clear out these starter posts,\nyou can delete the \"Ghost\" staff user. Deleting an author will automatically\nremove all of their posts, leaving you with a clean blank canvas.\n\nYour guide to Ghost\n * Customizing your brand and site settings [__GHOST_URL__/design/]\n * Writing & managing content, an advanced guide for creators\n   [__GHOST_URL__/write/]\n * Building your audience with subscriber signups [__GHOST_URL__/portal/]\n * Selling premium memberships with recurring revenue [__GHOST_URL__/sell/]\n * How to grow your business around an audience [__GHOST_URL__/grow/]\n * Setting up custom integrations and apps [__GHOST_URL__/integrations/]\n\nIf you get through all those and you're hungry for more, you can find an\nextensive library of content for creators over on the Ghost blog\n[https://ghost.org/blog/].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGetting help\nIf you need help, Ghost(Pro) [https://ghost.org/pricing/] customers can always\nreach our full-time support team by clicking on the Ghost(Pro) link inside their\nadmin panel.\n\nIf you're a developer working with the codebase in a self-managed install, check\nout our developer community forum [https://forum.ghost.org] to chat with other\nusers.\n\nHave fun!",
