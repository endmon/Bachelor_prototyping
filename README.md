# Web Content Rendering at the Edge


This repository contains several prototype projects. 

They were carried out to test edge computing (tools, providers, possibility, etc. ) as part of my Bachelor thesis.

Details of each project can be found in the README in each subfolder.

Each sub-folder is an independent project that can be deployed at the edge.
